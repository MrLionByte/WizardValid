## Simple React CRUD Application
This repository contains a simple React application built for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The frontend is developed using React, with global state management handled by Redux Toolkit. The backend is built with Django, using Django REST Framework for API endpoints and PostgreSQL as the database.

## CRUD Operations:
- Create, Read, Update, Delete functionalities for managing data.
- State Management: Redux Toolkit is used to manage the global state of the application.
- Backend: Django REST API serves the data to the React frontend.
- Database: PostgreSQL is used to store and manage data.
- HTTP Requests: Axios is used for sending API requests to the backend.

## Tech Stack:

### Frontend:
- React: For building the user interface.
- Redux Toolkit: For managing application state.
- Axios: For handling HTTP requests.

### Backend:
- Django: As the backend framework.
- Django REST Framework (DRF): For building the API endpoints.
- PostgreSQL: For the database.

### Usage:
- After starting both the frontend and backend servers, you can access the app at http://localhost:5173.
- Use the application to perform CRUD operations through the interface.
- All API requests are handled via Axios, and the data is fetched from the Django backend.
